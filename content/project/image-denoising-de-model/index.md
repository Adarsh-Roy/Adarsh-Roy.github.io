This project explores the use of non-local morphological Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) and p-Laplacian operators on graph structures for advanced image denoising and smoothing.

We extend traditional local models with graph-based non-local operators and also introduce fractional order anisotropic diffusion models for improved preservation of image features.
