gthr is a Rust CLI that lets you fuzzy-pick files or directories, then hit Ctrl-E to dump a syntax-highlighted Markdown digest straight to your clipboard and quit

Saving to a file and a few other customizations are also available.

This is perfect for browser-based LLM users or just sharing a compact digest of a bunch of text files with anyone.

Try it out with: `brew install adarsh-roy/gthr/gthr`
